# pPython for Mechanical Engineers – Rail Brake distance calculations


## Problem Definition

A runaway freight train sped down the hill… before the brakes were applied. The Train Operating Company would like to know if the braking distance complied to Railway Group Standards. Calculate the stopping distance of the train (equivalent for level track), and plot this data point on the GMRT2043 (Appendix A) curve V to show it does not exceed the maximum allowed braking distance.
